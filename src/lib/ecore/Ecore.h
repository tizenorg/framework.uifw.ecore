/**
 * @page Ecore_Main_Loop_Page The Ecore Main Loop
 *
 * @section Ecore_Main_Loop_Page_intro What is Ecore?
 *
 * Ecore is a clean and tiny event loop library with many modules to do lots of
 * convenient things for a programmer as well as to save time and effort. It's small and
 * lean, designed to work from embedded systems all the way up to large and
 * powerful multi-cpu workstations. The main loop has a number of primitives to
 * be used with its main loop. It serializes all the primitives and allows for
 * great responsiveness without the need for threads(or any other concurrency).
 *
 * @subsection timers Timers
 *
 * Timers serve two main purposes: doing something at a specified time and
 * repeatedly doing something with a set interval.
 * @see Ecore_Timer_Group
 *
 * @subsection pollers Pollers
 *
 * Pollers allow for polling to be centralized into a single place. Therefore,
 * alleviating the need for different parts of the program to wake up at
 * different times to do polling, thereby making the code simpler and more
 * efficient.
 * @see Ecore_Poller_Group
 *
 * @subsection idler Idlers
 *
 * There are three types of idlers: enterers, idlers(proper), and exiters, they
 * are called respectively when the program is about to enter an idle state,
 * when the program is idle, and when the program is leaving an idle state. Idler
 * enterers are usually a good place to update the program state. Proper idlers
 * are the appropriate place to do heavy computational tasks thereby using what
 * would otherwise be wasted CPU cycles. Exiters are the perfect place to do
 * anything that your program should do just before processing events(also timers,
 * poolers, file descriptor handlers, and animators)
 * @see Ecore_Idle_Group
 *
 * @subsection fd_handler File descriptor handlers
 *
 * File descriptor handlers allow you to monitor when there is data available to
 * read on file descriptors, when writing is not blocked or when there is an
 * error. Any valid file descriptor can be used with this API, regardless of whether
 * it is obtained with an OS specific API or from ecore.
 * @see Ecore_FD_Handler_Group
 *
 * @subsection animators Animators
 *
 * Ecore provides a facility called animators, so named since the intended use
 * is in animations, that facilitates knowing what percentage of a given
 * interval has elapsed. This is perfect for performing animations, but is not
 * limited to that use. It can, for example, also be used to create a progress
 * bar.
 * @see Ecore_Animator_Group
 *
 * @subsection ev_handlers Event handlers
 *
 * Event handlers are, arguably, the most important feature of the ecore main
 * loop, they are what allows the programmer to easily handle user interaction.
 * Events, however, are not the only things that the user does. Events can represent
 * anything for which a type is created.
 * @see Ecore_Event_Group
 *
 * All of these primitives are discussed in more detail in their respective
 * pages that are linked above.
 *
 * Here is a diagram of the main loop flow of a simple program:
 *
 * @image html  prog_flow.png
 * @image latex prog_flow.eps "prog flow" width=\textwidth
 *
 * @section Ecore_Main_Loop_Page_work How does Ecore work?
 *
 * Ecore is very easy to learn and use. All the function calls are designed to
 * be easy to remember, explicit in describing what they do, and heavily
 * name-spaced. Ecore programs can start easily and are very simple.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * This program is very simple and doesn't check for errors, but it does start up
 * and begin a main loop that is waiting for events or timers to tick off. This program
 * doesn't set up any, but now we can expand on this simple program a little
 * more by adding some event handlers and timers.
 *
 * In the previous example, we initialize our application and get the time at
 * which our program has started so that we can calculate an offset. We set
 * up a timer to tick off in @c 0.5 seconds, and since it returns @c 1, it
 * keeps ticking off every @c 0.5 seconds until it returns @c 0, or is deleted
 * by hand. An event handler is set up to call a function -
 * exit_func(),
 * whenever an event of type ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_EXIT is received (CTRL-C
 * on the command line causes such an event to happen). If this event
 * occurs it tells you what kind of exit signal is received, and asks
 * the main loop to quit when it is finished by calling
 * ecore_main_loop_quit().
 *
 * The handles returned by ecore_timer_add() and
 * ecore_event_handler_add() are
 * only stored here as an example. If you don't need to address the timer or
 * event handler again you don't need to store the result, so just call the
 * function and don't assign the result to any variable.
 *
 * This program looks slightly more complex than needed to do these simple
 * things, but in principle, programs don't get any more complex. You add more
 * event handlers for more events, you have more timers, BUT it all
 * follows the same principles as shown in this example.
 *

   many features using the Enlightenment 17 development libraries.

   To use the library, you:
   @li Set the default values of your properties.
   @li Load the configuration from a file. You must set the default values

 *
 * @brief Ecore event are a helper to create events are being notified of events.
 *
 * Ecore events provide two main features that are of use to those using ecore:
 * creating events and being notified of events. Those two are usually used
 * in different contexts, creating events is mainly done by libraries wrapping
 * some system functionality while being notified of events is mainly a
 * necessity of applications.
 *
 * For a program to be notified of events it's interested in, it needs to have a
 * function to process the event and to register that function as the callback
 * to the event, that's all:
 * @code
 * ecore_event_handler_add(EVENT_TYPE, _my_event_handler, some_data);
 * ...
 * static Eina_Bool
 * _my_event_handler(void *data, int type, void *event)
 * {
 *    //Data is some_data
 *    //Event is provided by whoever created the event
 *    //Do really cool stuff with the event
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * One very important thing to note here is the @c EVENT_TYPE. To register a
 * handler for an event, you must know its type before hand. Ecore provides
 * the following events that are emitted in response to POSIX
 * signals(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28computing%29):
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_USER
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_HUP
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_POWER
 * @li @b ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_EXIT
 *
 * Don't override these using the @c signal or @c sigaction calls.
 * These, however, aren't the only signals one can handle. Many
 * libraries(including ecore modules) have their own signals that can be
 * listened to and handled. To do that one only needs to know the type of the
 * event. This information can be found on the documentation of the library
 * emitting the signal. 
 * @internal
 * So, for example, for events related to windowing one
 * would use @ref Ecore_Evas_Group.
 *
 * Examples of libraries that integrate into ecore's main loop by providing
 * events are @ref Ecore_Con_Group, @ref Ecore_Evas_Group, and @ref
 * Ecore_Exe_Group, amongst others.
 * @endinternal
 *
 * This usage can be divided into two parts,
 * setup and adding events. The setup is very simple, all that needs to be done is
 * getting a type ID for the event:
 * @code
 * int MY_EV_TYPE = ecore_event_type_new();
 * @endcode
 * This variable should be declared in the header since it is needed by
 * anyone wishing to register a handler to your event.
 *
 * The complexity of adding an event to the queue depends on whether that

 *
 * @brief Facilities to run heavy tasks in different threads to avoid blocking
 *        the main loop.
 *
 * The EFL is, for the most part, not thread safe. This means that if you
 * have some task running in another thread and you have, for example, an
 * Evas object to show the status progress of this task, you cannot update
 * the object from within the thread. This can only be done from the main
 * thread, the one running the main loop. This problem can be solved
 * by running a thread that sends messages to the main one using an
 * @ref Ecore_Pipe_Group "Ecore_Pipe", but when you need to handle other
 * things like cancelling the thread, your code grows in complexity and gets
 * much harder to maintain.
 *
 * Ecore Thread is here to solve that problem. It is not a simple wrapper
 * around standard POSIX threads (or an equivalent in other systems) and
 * it's not meant to be used to run parallel tasks throughout the entire
 * duration of the program, especially when these tasks are performance
 * critical, as Ecore manages these tasks using a pool of threads based on
 * system configuration.
 *
 * What Ecore Thread does is it makes it a lot easier to dispatch a worker
 * function to perform some heavy tasks and then get the result once it
 * completes, without blocking the application's UI. In addition, cancelling
 * and rescheduling comes practically for free and the developer need not
 * worry about how many threads are launched, since Ecore schedules
 * them according to the number of processors the system has and the maximum
 * amount of concurrent threads set for the application.
 *
 * At the system level, Ecore starts a new thread on an as-needed basis
 * until the maximum set is reached. When no more threads can be launched,
 * new worker functions are queued in a waiting list until a thread
 * becomes available. This way, system threads are shared throughout
 * different worker functions, but running only one at a time. At the same
 * time, a worker function that is rescheduled may be run on a different
 * thread the next time.
 *
 * The ::Ecore_Thread handler has two meanings, depending on what context
 * it is on. The one returned when starting a worker with any of the
 * functions ecore_thread_run() or ecore_thread_feedback_run() is an
 * identifier of that specific instance of the function and can be used from
 * the main loop with the ecore_thread_cancel() and ecore_thread_check()
 * functions. This handler must not be shared with the worker function
 * running in the thread. This same handler is the one received
 * on the @c end, @c cancel, and @c feedback callbacks.
 *
 * The worker function, that's the one running in the thread, also receives
 * an ::Ecore_Thread handler that can be used with ecore_thread_cancel() and
 * ecore_thread_check(), sharing the flag with the main loop. But this
 * handler is also associated with the thread where the function is running.
 * This has strong implications when working with thread local data.
 *
 * There are two kinds of worker threads that Ecore handles: simple or short,
 * workers, and feedback workers.
 *
 * The first kind is for simple functions that perform a
 * usually small but time consuming task. Ecore runs this function in
 * a thread as soon as one becomes available and notifies the calling user of
 * its completion once the task is done.
 *
 * The following image shows the flow of a program running four tasks on
 * a pool of two threads.
 *
 * @image html ecore_thread.png
 * @image rtf ecore_thread.png
 * @image latex ecore_thread.eps "ecore thread" width=\textwidth
 *
 * For larger tasks that may require continuous communication with the main
 * program, the feedback workers provide the same functionality plus a way
 * for the function running in the thread to send messages to the main
 * thread.
 *
 * The next diagram omits some details shown in the previous one regarding
 * how threads are spawned and tasks are queued, but illustrates how feedback
 * jobs communicate with the main loop and the special case of threads
 * running out of the pool.

 *
 * @remarks Once a thread becomes available, @a func_blocking is run in it until

 *          main loop to inform the user of its completion. While in @a func_blocking,
 *          no functions from the EFL can be used, except for those from Eina that are
 *          marked to be thread-safe. Even for the latter, caution needs to be taken
 *          if the data is shared across several threads.
 *
 * @remarks @a func_end is called from the main thread when @a func_blocking ends,
 *          so here it's safe to use anything from the EFL freely.
 *
 * @remarks The thread can also be cancelled before its completion by calling
 *          ecore_thread_cancel(), either from the main thread or @a func_blocking.
 *          In this case, @a func_cancel is called, also from the main thread
 *          to inform of this happening. If the thread could not be created, this
 *          function is called and its @c thread parameter is @c NULL. It's
 *          also safe to call any EFL function here, as it is running in the

 *
 * @remarks Inside @a func_blocking, it's possible to call ecore_thread_reschedule()

 * @remarks Be aware that no assumptions can be made about the order in which the

 *          schedule, and different functions may take longer to finish than others.
 *          Also remember that just starting several tasks together doesn't mean they
 *          are going to run at the same time. Ecore schedules them based on the
 *          number of threads available for the particular system it's running in,

 *
 * @remarks Like with ecore_thread_run(), a new thread is launched to run
 *          @a func_heavy unless the maximum number of simultaneous threads has been
 *          reached, in which case the function is scheduled to run whenever a
 *          running task ends and a thread becomes free. But if @a try_no_queue is
 *          set, Ecore first tries to launch a thread outside of the pool to run

 *
 * @remarks Keep in mind that Ecore handles the thread pool based on the number of

/**
 * @brief Adds some data present in the hash local to the thread. 
 *
 * @since_tizen 2.3
 *
 * @remarks Ecore Thread has a mechanism to share data across several worker functions
 *          that run on the same system thread. That is, the data is stored per
 *          thread and for a worker function to have access to it, it must be run
 *          by the same thread that stored the data.
 *
 * @remarks When there are no more workers pending, the thread is destroyed
 *          along with the internal hash and any data left in it is freed with
 *          the given @a cb function.
 *
 * @         This set of functions is useful to share things around several instances
 *          of a function when that thing is costly to create and can be reused, but
 *          may only be used by one function at a time.
 *
 *          For example, if you have a program doing requisitions to a database,
 *          these requisitions can be done in threads so that waiting for the
 *          database to respond doesn't block the UI. Each of these threads
 *          run a function, and each function is dependent on a connection to
 *          the database, which may not be able to handle more than one request at
 *          a time so for each running function you need one connection handle.
 * 
 *          The options then are:
 *          @li Each function opens a connection when it's called, does the work and
 *          closes the connection when it finishes. This may be costly, wasting a lot
 *          of time on resolving hostnames, negotiating permissions, and allocating
 *          memory.
 *          @li Open the connections in the main loop and pass it to the threads
 *          using the data pointer. Even worse, it's just as costly as before and now
 *          it may even be kept with connections open doing nothing until a thread
 *          becomes available to run the function.
 *          @li Have a way to share connection handles, so that each instance of the
 *          function can check if an available connection exists, and if it doesn't,
 *          create one and add it to the pool. When no more connections are needed,
 *          they are all closed.
 *
 *          The last option is the most efficient, but it requires a lot of work to
 *          be implemented properly. Using thread local data helps to achieve the same
 *          result while avoiding all the tracking work on your code. The way
 *          to use it would be at the worker function, to ask for the connection
 *          using ecore_thread_local_data_find() and if it doesn't exist, then open
 *          a new one and save it with ecore_thread_local_data_add(). Complete the work and
 *          forget about the connection handle, when everything is done the function
 *          just ends. The next worker to run on that thread checks if a
 *          connection exists and finds that it does, so the process of opening a
 *          new one has been spared. When no more workers exist, the thread is
 *          destroyed and the callback used when saving the connection is called
 *          to close it.
 *
 * @remarks This function adds the data @a value to the thread data under the given
 *          @a key. No other value in the hash may have the same @a key. If you need to
 *          change the value under a @a key, or you don't know if one exists already,
 *          you can use ecore_thread_local_data_set().
 *
 *          Neither @a key nor @a value may be @c NULL and @a key gets copied in the
 *          hash, unless @a direct is set, in which case the string used should not
 *          be freed until the data is removed from the hash.
 *
 * @remarks The @a cb function is called when the data in the hash needs to be
 *          freed, be it because it got deleted by ecore_thread_local_data_del() or
 *          because @a thread got terminated and the hash got destroyed. This parameter
 *          may be @c NULL, in which case @a value needs to be manually freed after
 *          removing it from the hash with either ecore_thread_local_data_del() or
 *          ecore_thread_local_data_set(), but it's very unlikely that this is what
 *          you want.
 *
 *          This function, and all of the others in the @a ecore_thread_local_data
 *          family of functions, can only be called within the worker function running

 *
 * @remarks Ecore is smart enough to see if there are timers in the

 *        program isn't handling @ref Ecore_Event_Group "events", @ref Ecore_Timer_Group
 *        "timers", or @ref Ecore_FD_Handler_Group "fd handlers".
 *
 * There are three types of idlers: Enterers, Idlers(proper), and Exiters. They
 * are called respectively when the program is about to enter an idle state,
 * when the program is in an idle state and when the program has just left an
 * idle state and begins processing @ref Ecore_Event_Group "events", @ref
 * Ecore_Timer_Group "timers", or @ref Ecore_FD_Handler_Group "fd handlers".
 *
 * Enterer callbacks are good for updating your program's state, if
 * it has a state engine. Once all of the enterer handlers are
 * called, the program enters a "sleeping" state.
 *
 * Idler callbacks are called when the main loop has called all
 * enterer handlers. They are useful for interfaces that require
 * polling and timers without which they would be too slow to use.
 *
 * Exiter callbacks are called when the main loop wakes up from an idle state.
 *
 * If no idler callbacks are specified, then the process literally
 * goes to sleep.  Otherwise, the idler callbacks are called
 * continuously while the loop is "idle", using as much CPU as is
 * available to the process.
 *
 * Idle state doesn't mean that the @b program is idle, but
 * that the <b>main loop</b> is idle. It doesn't have any timers,
 * events, fd handlers, or anything else to process (which in most
 * <em>event driven</em> programs also means that the @b program is
 * idle too, but it's not a rule). The program itself may be doing
 * a lot of processing in the idler, or in another thread, for
 * example.
